# Kubernetes Log Investigation

Use this skill to triage pod logs with a token-efficient workflow:
find anchor log lines that match high-signal problem patterns first, then
expand around those anchors, and only
fetch full logs as a last resort.

## When to use it

- The user asks to investigate Kubernetes logs.
- Logs may be very large and expensive to retrieve in full.
- The goal is to find actionable errors quickly.

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Scope and pod selection

1. **Confirm scope first.** Identify cluster context, namespace, workload,
   and time window. Ask for missing values before pulling logs.
2. **Pick target pods.** Prefer the newest unhealthy pod(s) from the
   workload selector. If multiple replicas fail, sample one or two first.
3. **Start with a narrow log window.** Pull only a recent slice (for
   example `--tail=200` and optionally `--since=10m`).

### Phase 2: Anchor search

4. **Search for anchors, do not dump all logs.** Treat anchors as log lines
   matching high-signal problem patterns (case-insensitive), for example:
   - `error|warn|warning|fatal|panic|exception|traceback`
   - `failed|failure|timeout|timed out|refused|unavailable`
   - `oomkilled|backoff|crashloop|segfault`

### Phase 3: Anchor expansion and lifecycle correlation

5. **Expand around anchors with small context.** For each interesting
   match, expand with `grep -A 5 -B 5` (or equivalent). Keep the first
   expansion small.
6. **Iterate context size gradually.** If needed, increase to `-A 20 -B 20`,
   then `-A 50 -B 50` for the same anchor. Do not jump to full logs early.
7. **Correlate with container lifecycle.** If restart/crash behavior is
   present, check previous container logs (`--previous`) and compare with
   current logs.

### Phase 4: If anchors are missing

8. **Widen carefully and retry anchor search.** Increase tail/since window
   and repeat Phase 2 before considering full logs.
9. **Last resort only: retrieve complete logs.** Pull full logs only when
   anchor search and progressive widening fail to produce clues.

### Phase 5: Report

10. **Report findings succinctly.** Provide top anchors, short surrounding
    excerpts, likely root cause category, and the smallest next action.

## Suggested command patterns

Use `bash` with `kubectl` and shell pipes, or equivalent MCP read-only log
calls, while preserving the same strategy.

```bash
# Current logs, narrow window
kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod> --tail=200 --since=10m

# Anchor search
kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod> --tail=2000 --since=30m | \
  grep -Ei 'error|warn|warning|fatal|panic|exception|failed|timeout|refused|oomkilled|crashloop'

# Small contextual expansion around a specific anchor term
kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod> --tail=4000 --since=1h | \
  grep -Ein -A 5 -B 5 'timeout|connection refused|panic'

# Previous container logs for crash loops
kubectl logs -n <ns> <pod> --previous --tail=500
```

## Hard rules

- Never fetch full logs first when the stream can be sampled and searched.
- Never run destructive Kubernetes commands during log investigation.
- Never include secrets/tokens found in logs in the final response; redact.
- If access is denied, report the permission boundary instead of retrying
  with guessed credentials.

## Output rule

Always finish with a single line: `Result: ok | needs-attention | blocked`.
