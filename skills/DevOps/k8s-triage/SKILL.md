# Kubernetes Triage

This skill is the *playbook* the agent follows for any K8s incident. It
assumes either:

- a `kubectl` binary is reachable through the `bash` tool, **or**
- a Kubernetes MCP server is mounted (preferred — it gives structured
  output and respects permissions).

If neither `kubectl` nor Kubernetes MCP is available, stop command-based
triage and ask the user for manual evidence (for example: `kubectl get`
output, `describe pod`, recent events, and the last 200 log lines).

If the investigation becomes log-heavy (for example: log output exceeds about
5,000 lines or ~5 MB, no clear anchors after scanning at least 2,000 recent
lines, or the same pod restarts 3+ times within 30 minutes), load
`k8s-log-investigation` and follow its token-efficient anchor-first workflow.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm the cluster context.** Run `kubectl config current-context`
   (or the MCP equivalent) and quote it back to the user before doing
   anything else.
2. **Locate the workload.** Ask for namespace + name if not provided.
3. **Snapshot the state.** In one batch of read-only calls:
   - `kubectl get deploy/sts/ds <name> -n <ns> -o wide`
   - `kubectl get pods -n <ns> -l <selector> -o wide`
   - `kubectl describe pod <pod>` (the most recent unhealthy one)
   - `kubectl logs <pod> --previous --tail=200`
   - relevant `kubectl get events -n <ns> --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail`
4. **Classify the failure** into one of:
   - image / pull
   - scheduling (resource, taint, affinity)
   - probe (liveness / readiness)
   - configuration (env, secret, configmap)
   - network (service, dns, network policy)
   - permission (RBAC, PSP / PSA)
   - application (crashes after startup)
5. **Propose ONE next action** — never a multi-step mitigation in the
   first message. Always a dry-run first when possible (`--dry-run=server`).

## Hard rules

1. **Priority 1 (safety).** Never `kubectl delete` without explicit user
   confirmation.
2. **Priority 2 (production guardrails).** Never modify production
   namespaces (`prod`, `prd`, `production`, or any context containing
   `prod`) without an explicit user override.
3. **Priority 3 (access boundaries).** If RBAC denies a read, escalate —
   do not retry with a different account.
